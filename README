# *Illumination-Invariant Face Recognition*

---

## **Introduction**

This project implements an image processing-based approach for illumination-invariant face recognition. Inspired by the research paper *"A Methodology for Rapid Illumination-Invariant Face Recognition Using Image Processing Filters"* by *Ognjen Arandjelović and Roberto Cipolla*, this project integrates adaptive frameworks, image processing techniques, and similarity metrics to handle face recognition under challenging lighting conditions. The main objective is to create an efficient system that can identify faces even with significant illumination changes while maintaining computational efficiency.

3. **Adaptive Density Estimation**:
    - Estimates joint probability density functions that help adjust for illumination differences.
    - Dynamically learns the alpha-function to combine unprocessed and filtered data based on confusion margins.

## **Project Components**

The project is structured around several key components that align with the methodologies proposed in the research paper *"A Methodology for Rapid Illumination-Invariant Face Recognition Using Image Processing Filters"* by *Arandjelović and Cipolla.* Each component is crucial for handling face recognition under varying illumination conditions effectively.

### **1. Image Preprocessing and Filtering**

- **Self-Quotient Imaging (SQI)**: This technique is used for illumination normalization, a core part of the paper’s methodology. SQI transforms images to enhance their invariance to varying lighting conditions, making them more robust for face recognition.
- **High-Pass Filters (HP)**: Applied to accentuate high-frequency information while reducing low-frequency illumination effects. This aligns with the filtering methods discussed in the paper for better illumination normalization.
- **Additional Filters**: Filters like the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LG) and edge detection (Canny and directional derivatives) were explored for their efficacy in enhancing discriminative facial features.

### **2. Similarity Metrics and Face Matching Techniques**

- **Cosine Similarity**: A fundamental metric used to compute the angular similarity between feature vectors of the query and gallery images. This is a basic approach that was employed to establish a baseline for recognition.
- **Mutual Subspace Method (MSM)**: This method was included for its ability to compare subspaces formed by video sequences, crucial for handling the variation in pose and head motion as discussed in the paper. MSM is noted for its robustness and stability in recognizing faces under complex conditions.

### **3. Adaptive Framework for Illumination Handling**

- **Joint Probability Density Estimation**: A key aspect of the paper's approach is the estimation of joint probability density functions to understand the relationship between the query and gallery images under different lighting. This density estimation helps in identifying the optimal alpha value.
- **Alpha-Function Estimation**: The adaptive system learns the alpha-function, **`α*`**, which represents the optimal weighting of raw and filtered data based on the "confusion margin" (the difference between the top two matching scores). This dynamic adjustment is critical for improving recognition accuracy in diverse illumination scenarios.

### **4. Online Face Matching Workflow**

- **Integration of Filters and Similarity Methods**: The project integrates raw image data with filtered representations, applying the learned alpha-function to balance these contributions effectively. This combination allows for more accurate matching, especially in varying illumination conditions.
- **Decision Fusion Strategy**: The paper's methodology suggests combining unprocessed and filtered image data to yield a single matching score. The fusion strategy applies the learned alpha-function to adjust the contributions based on the confusion margin, ensuring optimal matching performance.

### **5. Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

- **User Input Handling**: The CLI enables users to input paths for the query image and gallery, select similarity methods, and initiate the face-matching process.
- **Visualization Tools**: Implements interactive displays using **`matplotlib`** to preview the query image, best match, and unmatched results, aiding in user verification and analysis.

### **6. Empirical Evaluation and Results Analysis**

- **Dataset Utilization**: The project uses datasets like **CamFace**, **ToshFace**, **Faces96**, and **YaleDB** to validate the performance of the system, as illustrated in the research paper's experiments.
- **Performance Metrics**: The system evaluates recognition accuracy, error rate reduction, and variability in performance across different filtering techniques and similarity methods. Results are compared against baseline methods to demonstrate improvements in recognition rates and stability under varying lighting conditions.

Each of these components is designed to align with the insights and techniques proposed in the paper, contributing to an effective illumination-invariant face recognition system

## **Core Functions**

- **`preview_image()`**: Displays images for visualization using `matplotlib`.
- **`self_quotient_image()`**: Performs illumination normalization to improve face recognition.
